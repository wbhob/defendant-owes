A simple website that shows the amount of money the plaintiff would have been due at a given time. Now, it's just a goof!

I realize the code is pretty verbose since it is all imports for what is effectively 15 real lines of code, but I put this together very quickly and did not anticipate it being so small.

Feel free to use this if someone owes you money or something, and you want to itemize your case. I almost had to use this myself.
